How to create a random cat command for your Discord bot (discord.py@rewrite)

## Stuff
I really do not care what you do with this, just don't hold me liable if it doesn't work or any other dumb shit like that.
If you want to see a random.dog command, contact me via Discord and I'll think about it, maybe.
